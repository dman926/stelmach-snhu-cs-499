# SNHU CS 340

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- Breaking down the main issue to smaller issues and components.
- Use of functions and comments.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

- I read over the requirements and started implementing them from bottom-up. The database is the most important part, and blocks future work until it's implemented, so it was first on the list.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Computer scientists manipulate computers through code. For applications like this, where some predetermined algorithms are utilized to get a result, a computer with well-written code will be able to quickly and easily compute the result, while a human would need to search over millions/billions of data points in order to get the result, potentially taking eternity.
